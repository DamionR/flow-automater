# npm resolution error report

While resolving: reservation-app@1.0.0
Found: react@18.0.0
node_modules/react
  dev react@"18.0.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@"^16.14.0 || ^17.0.0" from @shopify/polaris@9.24.0
node_modules/@shopify/polaris
  dev @shopify/polaris@"9.24.0" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
