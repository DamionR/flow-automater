## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/shopify-flow-generator.git
   cd shopify-flow-generator/backend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up the environment variables. Create a .env file and configure as shown below.

Environment Variables
The backend requires the following environment variables:

plaintext
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
PORT=3000
OPENAI_API_KEY: Your OpenAI API key for interacting with GPT models.
REDIS_URL: URL for the Redis instance (used for caching).
PORT: The port on which the server will run.
Copy the .env.example file as .env and fill in your values.

Usage
Start the server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The backend will run at http://localhost:3000 by default.

Send requests to the available API endpoints (see below).
